Welcome to Pokemon Pals! I built this application using Python & Flask, with Jinja2 templates, an SQLite database and CSS styling. The pokemon information is pulled from the 3rd party REST API PokeAPI

TO CLONE LOCALLY ON YOUR COMPUTER:
- Go to the main branch of the repository & hit the green "code" dropdown button.
- Copy the https URL
- Open a terminal on your machine & navigate to the directory where you want the project to live
- type: git clone copiedURL
- From there you can install the necessary dependencies then 'flask run' to see it in action!

Pokemon Pals is a simple gaming application where users can register to create an account, login, search for pokemon,
build teams of pokemon, and battle other players. This was the first full-stack project I ever created, so I was pretty proud to get this working
back when I built it! The battle functionality is pretty boring, so if I were to do this project over again or improve on it in any way,
I would make that part more complex and fun. I also would add dynamic screen-size styling & would probably make the UI more modern overall. I had fun
building this and for the most part it wasn't too complicated, but I learned that database modeling is my weak point and I need to beef up
my knowledge there for more complicated projects in the future.

As is, it is clean, easy to navigate, and does the trick! Enjoy! :)
